                            and cuddles. He’s energetic, smart, and funny. He loves (and needs)

                            Charlie and Gia are sweet puppies. They was rescued from 
                            Tennessee, but is looking to find her perfect match right 
                            here at your Port Washington, N.Y. campus. They would do 
                            best with experienced pet parents who can help them adjust 
                            to their new surroundings. Children 18 years and over would
                            pair best with them. They could do well with another dog, 
                            but we'd love for them to meet first. They are not a fan of 
                            cats though, so dog-only households please.

                            Cutie is a young, handsome pitbull  who has lots
                            of energy. He likes to be pet and enjoys attention.  On warm days, 
                            Charlie has fun splashing in a kiddie pool and playing with the spray 
                            from a hose.  Charlie is very smart and his adopter should be a strong 
                            leader who'll continue with his obedience training and will work with 
                            him on his sharing.  Charlie would do best in a rural or quiet suburban 
                            home with older teenagers and where he's the only pet.   He loves getting 
                            exercise outdoors and will be a great hiking companion!l
